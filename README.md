oCS2 Lasers Project

- The 2nd of two projects completed in Computer Science II @ RIT. Completed with one other classmate 
- The goal of the project was to create a Minesweeper-esque game called Lasers where the player would place
lasers on a grid with pillars filling some spaces on the grid. The goal was to fill every spot in the grid 
that wasn't already occupied by a pillar with a laser or laser beam. Certain pillars would only allow for a
certain number of lasers to be placed in their immediate vicinity. The game could be played from both a JavaFX
GUI or from a Plain Text UI. Players could add/remove lasers in any open spot on the grid, as well as check if
their configuration was correct, and even ask for a backtracker to solve to puzzle for them!
- All in all this project was a challenging but rewarding project, that allowed for me and my partner to work
on both our programming and teamwork skills
