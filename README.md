#CS2 Lasers Project

- The 2nd of two projects completed in Computer Science II at RIT. Completed with one other classmate, Oscar Onyeke
- The goal of the project was to create a Minesweeper-esque game called Lasers. In Lasers, the game board was a grid that was occupied by blank spaces and pillars. The goal was to fill every spot in the grid that wasn't already occupied by a pillar with a laser or laser beam. Certain pillars would only allow for a certain number of lasers to be placed in their immediate vicinity. The game could be played from both a JavaFX GUI or from a Plain Text UI. Players could add/remove lasers in any open spot on the grid, as well as check if their configuration was correct, and even ask for a backtracker to solve the puzzle for them!
- All in all this project was a challenging but rewarding project, that allowed for me and my partner to work on both our programming and teamwork skills
- __WARNING__: Any current CS2 students that choose to use this code, you run the (likely) risk of obtaining a failing grade for both this project and the course as a whole
